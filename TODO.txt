Maybe have livegrep-github-reindex run the blame command, and write the output
to file
  Right now the server loads blame on startup, and it tries to hold it in memory
  However, on huge repositorys (like nytimes-covid-data), this takes forever,
  and is going to be massiiive. Loading it from file (or memcache) makes more
  sense, as well as offloading the computation work to a seperate process, so it
  can be done at the same time as the repos are updating/updated
Customize the help to point to me on slack maybe?
