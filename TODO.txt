Maybe have livegrep-github-reindex run the blame command, and write the output
to file
  Right now the server loads blame on startup, and it tries to hold it in memory
  However, on huge repositorys (like nytimes-covid-data), this takes forever,
  and is going to be massiiive. Loading it from file (or memcache) makes more
  sense, as well as offloading the computation work to a seperate process, so it
  can be done at the same time as the repos are updating/updated
Customize the help to point to me on slack maybe?
REDO THE WHOLE THING WITH GO-GIT. 
  The current implementation takes ~14mins to init event with a concurrency of
  ~2000repos, because a select few repos take up almost the entire time
  Test new implementation on the slowest repos 
  load repo information (blame,log,etc) only once someone does a fileview within
  that repo (have to deal with the case when the repo info is being loaded....)

## for other branches
Add memcache to the server
Experiment (in kubernetes) with multiple pods of a CS backend, and an
