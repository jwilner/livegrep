# Enable remote caching. Remote cache is implemented as 
# a simple GCS bucket, which is publicly readable but can only be written to
# on commits to main, for which we assume trust, unlike PR's and
# other anonymous builds.
# The cache is available here: https://storage.googleapis.com/livegrep-bazel-remote-cache. 
# Having the cache publicly readable allows PRs and local developers to use it for their builds. 

# Favoring a remote cache rather than the GH actions cache because the
# GH actions cache doesn't support updating the cache content for a key because
# caches are immutable, which renders what Bazel does best moot. For example,
# if we create a cache entry with a key linux-HASH(WORKSPACE) and create a build,
# the initial build contents will be cached. But for ANY subsequent runs that
# don't update the WORKSPACE file (which is pretty much all of them) bazel can't
# add any artifcats to the cache, which destroys the build times of newer code!

# Another cool side effect of enabling/using a remote cache is that since 
# we spread out our CI to run `bazel build` for multiple OS's, we
# seed the cache with the build outputs of multiple OSs, allowing
# most developers to use the remote cache on their local machines, since most
# devs are using either linux/macOS

# If you'd like to set up a remote build cache for your fork:
# 1. Set up GCS cache: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/remote-caching.html#google-cloud-storage
# 2. Add a GCP_SVC_ACCT_CREDS repository secret that has the service account key
#    that you created in step 1.
